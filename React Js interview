    JavaScript is a dynamic (or dynamically typed) language.
    Key Characteristics of Dynamic Typing in JavaScript:
    No Type Declarations: You do not need to declare variable types. Variables can hold any type of value and can change types at runtime.
    let value = 42;    // value is a number
    value = "hello";   // value is now a string
    Type Inference: The type of a variable is determined by the value it holds. The type can change as the variable is assigned new values.
    let message = "This is a string"; // JavaScript infers that message is a string
    message = 100;                    // JavaScript now infers that message is a number
    Runtime Type Checking: Type errors are often only caught during execution, not during the compilation phase (since there's no compilation step as in statically typed languages).

javascript
Copy code
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

console.log(add(5, 10));    // 15
console.log(add(5, "10"));  // "510"


❖ NPM(Node Package Manager) is used to manage the dependencies for your React project, including the React library itself.
1.What are the major features of ReactJS?

   ** The major features of ReactJS are as follows,
   - It uses VirtualDOM instead RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
   - Supports server-side rendering
   - Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding
   - Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view

=> Cross-platform is the ability of software applications to operate on multiple operating systems (OS) or hardware platforms with little or no modification. 
2. Hooks are a feature that was introduced in React 16.8. They enable you to use state and other React features without having to write a class.
   They’re called Hooks because they allow you to “hook” into React features. 
   One example is the useState Hook, which allows you to add React state to function components.

   - With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. 
     Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.
      This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.

3. Props
    Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. 
    They are read-only, meaning that a child component cannot modify the props it receives.
    Props allow components to be dynamic and reusable.

    Usage: To pass information from one component to another.
    Immutable: Once set, they cannot be changed by the child component
4.State
    State is used to manage data that changes over time within a component. 
    Unlike props, a component can update its own state. 
    When the state changes, the component re-renders to reflect those changes.

    Usage: To manage dynamic data within a component.
    Mutable: Can be changed using the setState method in class components or the useState hook in functional components.

5. Class components in React are a way to define components using JavaScript classes. 
    They have more features compared to functional components, such as the ability to manage local state and lifecycle methods. 
    Here's a simple explanation and example.  

    class Greeting extends Component {
          constructor(props) {
                  super(props);
                  this.state = { name: 'World' }; // Initial state
                            }
                  render() {
                        return()
                      }

  Summary
    Class Components: Use JavaScript classes to create components.
    State: Managed internally, allows the component to be dynamic.
    Lifecycle Methods: Offer hooks into different phases of the component's life.
    Event Handlers: Methods within the class can handle events and update state.
    Class components provide a powerful way to build dynamic and stateful components in React.
    However, with the introduction of hooks, functional components are often preferred for their simplicity and ease of   use.

6.  Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.
      They should be avoided in most cases, however, they can be useful when we need direct access to the DOM element 
       or an  instance of a component.

**There are a few good use cases for refs:
  -  Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.

  -  Triggering imperative animations.

  -  Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

    Refs are created using React.createRef() and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. 
    Refs are commonly assigned to an instance property when a component is constructed so they can be referenced       throughout the component.

7. What is Context API in ReactJS?
      Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
 ---Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. Using context, we can avoid passing 
   props through intermediate elements.

8. Destructuring in JavaScript is a convenient way of extracting multiple values from arrays or objects and assigning them to variables. This feature makes your code cleaner and more readable by allowing you to unpack values directly from data structures.

9.We use Babel with React to transpile the JSX code into simple React functions that can be understood by browsers.
  1. Transpiling JSX:
  React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
  Browsers cannot understand JSX directly, so Babel transpiles it into regular JavaScript functions that the browser can interpret.
  For example, the JSX code <div>Hello</div> is transformed into React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello').
